initial desission :  ["**Signal:** Buy\n**Stop-Loss:** 2398.50\n**Take-Profit:** 2411.00\n**Explanation:** The XAUUSD price has shown a bullish breakout above the recent resistance level at $2397, and the MACD histogram is positive with increasing momentum. This indicates an uptrend in the short-term. Additionally, the Stochastic Oscillator is improving towards the overbought region but hasn't reached it yet, suggesting further room for price growth. Given these factors, a buy signal is generated with a stop-loss level set at $2398.50 to limit potential losses if the trend reverses unexpectedly, and a take-profit level of $2411.00 to capture profits from this scalping opportunity.", '**Signal:** Sell\n**Stop-Loss:** 2406.75\n**Take-Profit:** 2413.25\n**Explanation:** The XAUUSD price has formed a bearish engulfing pattern after breaking above the resistance at $2405, indicating a potential trend reversal to the downside.
